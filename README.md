# Royalties
This OS application reads in data from thousands of song listings (in .csv format) and analyzes that data to show the cost of royalties per song, per territory and/or per income source. Aside from the front end aspect of building a workable UI, the backend requires multiple data structures ranging from simple dictionaries, to more complex trees that ouputs data similar to how a data frame would in R.
